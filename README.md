## The Nakba

The Nakba, Arabic for "catastrophe," refers to the forced displacement and dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs that took place during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It led to the establishment of the State of Israel. 70+ massacres occurred and 531 Palestinian village were razed to the ground. The Nakba resulted in the loss of homes, land, and livelihood for many Palestinians, and it 
remains a deeply significant and painful historical event for them. The term is often used to describe both the events of 1948 and the ongoing consequences for the Palestinian people.
