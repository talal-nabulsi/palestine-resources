## The Nakba

The Nakba, Arabic for "catastrophe," refers to the forced displacement and dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs that took place during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It led to the establishment of the State of Israel. 70+ massacres occurred and 531 Palestinian village were razed to the ground. The Nakba resulted in the loss of homes, land, and livelihood for many Palestinians, and it 
remains a deeply significant and painful historical event for them. The term is often used to describe both the events of 1948 and the ongoing consequences for the Palestinian people.

- Huwara pogrom - https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/15/middleeast/huwara-west-bank-settler-attack-cmd-intl/index.html
> CNN found that, not only did the forces fail to stop the riots in Huwara, they did not protect residents as settlers set fire to Palestinian homes and businesses and blocked emergency services from responding. Instead, when residents threw rocks in reaction to the settlersâ€™ aggression, Israeli forces fired at the Palestinians with tear gas and stun grenades, according to analysis of the footage and eyewitness accounts.
